Sure, I can help you write a basic trial division algorithm in CUDA C. However, please note that this algorithm is not particularly suitable for GPU acceleration due to its sequential nature. Nevertheless, here's a simple version:



#include <stdio.h>

#define THREADS_PER_BLOCK 256

__global__ void trial_division(int *numbers, int *factors, int size) {
    int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (tid < size) {
        for (int i = 2; i <= 32; i++) {
            if (numbers[tid] % i == 0) {
                factors[tid] = i;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main(void) {
    int size = 10000;
    int *numbers, *factors;
    int *d_numbers, *d_factors;

    // Allocate space for host copies of data
    numbers = (int *)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    factors = (int *)malloc(size * sizeof(int));

    // Allocate space for device copies of data
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_numbers, size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_factors, size * sizeof(int));

    // Initialize data on host
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        numbers[i] = i + 2;  // Skip 0 and 1
        factors[i] = 1;
    }

    // Copy data from host to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_numbers, numbers, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch kernel with one thread per element
    trial_division<<<(size + THREADS_PER_BLOCK - 1) / THREADS_PER_BLOCK, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(d_numbers, d_factors, size);

    // Copy data from device to host
    cudaMemcpy(factors, d_factors, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Cleanup
    free(numbers);
    free(factors);
    cudaFree(d_numbers);
    cudaFree(d_factors);

    return 0;
}


This code launches a kernel with each thread handling one number. The trial division is done sequentially within each thread, which is not ideal for GPU parallelization.

For better performance, you might want to consider more GPU-friendly factorization algorithms, such as the Quadratic Sieve or the Number Field Sieve, or use libraries like CUDALibrary, cuPrime, or NVIDIA's CUDA-accelerated Math Libraries.

Also, remember to compile this code with nvcc, NVIDIA's CUDA compiler.

Lastly, optimizing for a specific GPU like the T4 involves understanding its architecture and adjusting parameters like the number of threads per block, using shared memory, and possibly using Tensor Cores for mixed-precision math. However, these optimizations are highly dependent on the specific algorithm and data, and can't be easily generalized.
