**Tips for Testing the Chosen Algorithm:**

- **Vary the Number of Threads:** Beyond the number of logical threads available on your processor, increasing the number of threads significantly may not yield benefits due to the overhead introduced.
- **Vary the Load:** The saturation point is reached when performance no longer improves.

Analyze the scalability of the algorithm and present concrete results to the Professor with easily readable graphs.

**Professor's Advice:**

- In the graph showing speed-up and execution time as the number of threads varies, include several curves with different data sizes to demonstrate how the algorithm performs under varying loads.
